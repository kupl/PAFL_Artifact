# Benchmark

To reproduce our experiments, you need to install [BugsCpp](https://github.com/Suresoft-GLaDOS/bugscpp.git),
[BugsInPy](https://github.com/soarsmu/BugsInPy.git), and [coverage data](#coverage-data) in your **PAFL** directory.

### BugsCpp installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Suresoft-GLaDOS/bugscpp.git
cd bugscpp; make install; cd ..
```

To download the C/C++ projects used in our experiments, you can run the following script.

```sh
chmod +x docker/scripts/checkout_bugscpp.sh
docker/scripts/checkout_bugscpp.sh
```

### BugsInPy installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/soarsmu/BugsInPy.git
```

To download the Python projects used in our experiments, you can run the following script.

```sh
chmod +x docker/scripts/checkout_bugsinpy.sh
docker/scripts/checkout_bugsinpy.sh
```

### Coverage data

We provide pre-executed coverage data to avoid running all test cases: [download link](https://figshare.com/s/8d82745d78ade3bbab5d) (7 GB)\
After downloading from the link, extract the folder `coverage` and place it in `data/` in the **PAFL** directory.
`coverage` includes the fault locations oracles, every project's execution on its test suite, and the results of CNN-FL, RNN-FL, MLP-FL, and [Aeneas](https://github.com/ICSE2022FL/ICSE2022FLCode.git)

# Installation

There are two ways to install **PAFL**:

- building [docker container](#building-docker-container) (recommended)
- [native build](#native-build)

We recommend building a docker container since we provide the scripts for docker to reproduce our experiments.

## Building docker container

```sh
docker build --tag pafl $(pwd)
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/workspace pafl
```

### `docker build`

|    option    | description                           |
| :----------: | :------------------------------------ |
| `--tag pafl` | tag a built image as `pafl`           |
|     `.`      | build an image from current directory |

### `docker run`

|         option         | description                                                 |
| :--------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
|         `--rm`         | remove the container when it stopped                        |
|         `-it`          | enable real-time standard I/O                               |
| `-v $(pwd):/workspace` | mount `$(pwd)` in host machine to `/workspace` in container |
|         `pafl`         | create a container from the `pafl` image                    |

## Native build

### Requirements

`clang>=13` or `clang>=5, gcc>=9`

### CMake stages

1. Generate native build tool
   - `build/cmake.sh`
2. Run the native build tool
   - `build/make.sh`

**PAFL** executable path: `build/release/pafl`

# Reproducing Our Experiments

After installing the benchmark and running the [docker container](#building-docker-container), you are now ready to reproduce our experiments.
Initially, the current working directory is `/workspace`.
The structure of the container is as follows:

```
/workspace
|_ BugsInPy : BugsInPy framework
|_ coverage : consists of test suites, fault locations oracles, DLFL results, and Aeneas results
|_ bugscpp : BugsCpp framework
|_ source : stores buggy versions of the projects

/opt/PAFL
|_ build : consists of build scripts and executable file
|_ profile : stores PAFL models and log files
|_ example : small program for example
|	|_ example : repository
|	|_ test_example : test suites
|	|_ fault.json : fault locations oracle
|_ ...
```

### 1. Caching coverage data (optional)

To reduce the cost of parsing JSON format coverage data every time, you can run the following script.
However, `coverage` already has cached coverage data so that you can skip this part.

```sh
caching.sh
```

### 2. Running PAFL

To run the baseline fault localizer and **PAFL**, you can run the following script.

```sh
# Running SBFL
run_sbfl.sh
# Running DLFL
run_dlfl.sh
# Running Aeneas
run_aeneas.sh
```

We support parallelization using a fixed number of thread pools.
You can specify the number of threads by giving the desired number to the script (default is 1).

```sh
# Running SBFL with 16 threads
run_sbfl.sh 16
```

Cost reduction from parallelization is most effective when the project contains many source files.

The ranking list of statements is stored in this path:

- `<test_suite_directory>/__pafl__/<profile>/ranking.json`

If you want to understand details about the commands for running **PAFL**, please read [PAFL Command](#pafl-command).

<!-- ### 3. Evaluating PAFL

To get the summarized results, you can run the following script.

```sh
# Evaluating SBFL
eval_sbfl.sh
# Evaluating DLFL
eval_dlfl.sh
# Evaluating Aeneas
eval_aeneas.sh
```

The summarized results will be stored in `/workspace/evaluation` as XLSX format files. -->

### 3. Checking log files (optional)

Log files are stored in `/opt/pafl/profile`.
You can copy this folder to workspace by running `cp -r /opt/PAFL/profile /workspace`.

# PAFL Command

|     command     | description                                          |

|   `run-base`    | run baseline fault localizer                         |
|   `run-pafl`    | run PAFL                                             |
|     `train`     | train model of profile using fault location oracle   |
|    `profile`    | create or edit profile                               |
|  `profile-rm`   | delete profile                                       |
| `profile-reset` | delete model of profile (reset model version to 0)   |
|    `caching`    | cache coverage data of test suite for faster loading |

### Example command

```sh
# Set profile (language = C++, baseline = ochiai)
pafl profile example-ochiai cpp ochiai

# For version 1 to 5
for i in {1..4}; do
  pafl run-pafl -P example-ochiai -S example/example -T example/test_example/buggy-$i
  pafl train -P example-ochiai -S example/example -T example/test_example/buggy-$i -O example/fault.json
done
pafl run-pafl -P example-ochiai -S example/example -T example/test_example/buggy-5
